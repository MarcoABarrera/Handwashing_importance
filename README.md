Handwashing_importance

In this notebook we will have a deep look into Dr.Semmelweis data.
He was convinced that doctors contaminated hands were killing the newborn babies in hospitals.
So he recorded data points where he measured the changes between before handwashing and after.
My first approach with this project was while doing the datacamp course, however, I found it pretty interesting, since it shows how simple amount of data can be turned into a powerful insight.

Hope you enjoy :)
